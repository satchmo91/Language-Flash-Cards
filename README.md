# Language-Flash-Cards
A simple program to help you learn a new language. Submit word pairs in you foreign and native language and test your knowledge in both directions.

Run Language Flash Cards.exe to start program.

Initial Run :
The program will prompt you to create a user by inputting your first name, your native language, and the language you are intending to learn. 
 
 NOTE - On subsequent loads of the program, if only one user is present, the program will load that user automatically, 
 but if multiple users have been created, you will be prompted to select a user on startup. You can switch users any time from the Switch User option in the menu.
 
 Using the program :
Click Add New Words to go to the New Words Page where you can input foreign-native word pairs and associated tags if you wish to use them.

Go back to the main menu, select any tags you would like to filter by (selecting "all" or leaving all boxes unselected will effectively include all available word pairs in your vocabulary).
Select on of the two flash card options (Native to Foreign, or Foreign to Native -- the buttons will change to reflect the languages you are working with)

In the flash cards page, enter the correct matching word based on the random word provided. You can see lifetime stats in the User Info window available in the menu.

Lastly, clicking on the Vocabulary button at the top of the Main Menu page will bring you to a list of all of your available words. Double-click to edit the words,
or Right-click to quickly delete words.


NOTE - There are still a few features I plan to add in the future, but the program has all of the core functionality at this point.
